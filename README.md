## About The Project

![Screen Shot](assets/Qr_Gui.png)

This is a project that is still under development and missing a lot of features. Currently it works as follows:

* Start either one of three python variations (command line, tkinter Gui or PyQt5 Gui)
* Enter your url or other info and press Generate QR Image
* Click the save button to save it in the same folder :smile:

In the near future I'll add the following features plus whatever requests are expressed:
* SVG support
* General file extension support (png, jpg, jpeg, etc)
* file save location
* dimension settings

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

Python with QR module

### Prerequisites

Dependencies are PyQt5, tkinter and QR, depending on the version you use.
